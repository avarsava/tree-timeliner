tree-timeliner

Prerequisites:
- Python 3.10
- tree

Creates many json files detailing all of the files modified up to the timestamp
specified in the filename. Timestamps are chosen based on the set of unique
modification times in the directory tree.

Takes a root directory and optionally `--verbose` if you want a lot
of console output.

Intended for use on a directory structure not modified by humans, so that
modification time is a decent substitute for creation time.

Open the output in a diffing tool to understand the evolution of your
directory over time.

The original use case was a remote instrument writing many files to our
servers and a need to understand what order the files get written out.
